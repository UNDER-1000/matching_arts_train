🖼️ Project Overview

This project allows users to provide feedback (like/dislike) on images, and trains models to predict preferences based on CLIP embeddings and color features, and 3 classifiers [noise, abstract, paint].

✅ Workflow
	1.	Input:
	•	Three predefined categories: noise, abstract, paint.
	•	A list of image_ids (which correspond to filenames in a directory).
	•	A list of labels (1 = like, 0 = dislike) corresponding to each image.
	2.	Feature Extraction:
	•	Extract CLIP embeddings and color features separately.
	3.	Model Training:
	•	Train individual models on each feature set.
	•	Generate 5 prediction scores per image (from various models).
	•	Train a final classifier on these 5 scores to make the final prediction.
	4.	Data Handling:
	•	Uses Polars DataFrames and NumPy for efficient processing.
	•	A CSV file is used to persist the feature and label data.

🛠️ Structure
	•	main.py: FastAPI server entry point.
	•	logic.py: Orchestrates the training and prediction pipeline.
	•	features.py: Used when performing a full restart (rebuilds features from scratch).
	•	classifiers_api.py, colors_api.py, embeddings_api.py: Handle prediction of individual models; used during restarts.
	•	config.py: Contains configurable constants (e.g., paths, folders).
	•	show.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook to visualize image preferences and model predictions.

🚀 Running the Server

Make sure uv is installed, then run:

uv run main.py

🔁 Restart Option

Use the restart mode only the first time (or when rebuilding from scratch). It regenerates the CSV.
